Hello! ðŸ™‚ 

:mortar_board: I'm a economist by degree and I'm currently working as a *Machine Learning Engineer*, being directly involved in the creation of Pipelines on *Google Cloud Platform* (GCP). I have also worked in several stages of the model development life cycle, from data collection and processing to deployment and monitoring models in production.

:computer: In my day-to-day work, I use data analysis, programming, code versioning and demand organization tools, such as *Python*, *SQL*, *BigQuery*, *Vertex AI*, *Github*, *Jira* and *Kanbanize*.

:envelope_with_arrow: You can reach me via [e-mail](deborakassem@live.com) or in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/debora-kassem-buturi/) web page.
